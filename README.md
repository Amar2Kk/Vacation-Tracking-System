# 🏖️ Vacation-Tracking-System

## 📋 Overview

This project involves developing a web-based Vacation Tracking System to help businesses manage employee vacation time more effectively. As modern workplaces evolve, employees often work across multiple projects and report to different managers, making it challenging for leaders to track and approve time-off requests informally.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The system addresses the difficulty of managing vacation time in decentralized work environments by:

-   Providing a centralized platform for employees to request time off and for managers to approve/reject requests
-   Integrating with the company's existing intranet for seamless access
-   Ensuring visibility of employee availability across teams to avoid scheduling conflicts

By automating vacation tracking, the system reduces administrative overhead and improves workforce planning.

## 🚀 Vision

The Vacation Tracking System (VTS) aims to empower employees by giving them direct control over managing their vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off—without requiring deep knowledge of complex company policies.
